This repository contains a Python-based engine designed to optimize Multiplier and D'Alembert betting strategies. The script utilizes a stochastic search loop to identify the most efficient wager sizes and multipliers by simulating thousands of trials to maximize ROI while minimizing the risk of ruin. Although the current execution focuses on Multiplier logic, the full implementation for D'Alembert and Martingale optimization is preserved within the source code, with some secondary analysis and 3D plotting routines stored in commented blocks for modular use.
